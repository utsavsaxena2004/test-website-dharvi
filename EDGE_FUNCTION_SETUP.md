# Supabase Edge Function Email Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed
âœ… **Checkout Flow**: Fixed redirect to cart after successful payment
âœ… **Email Service**: Added fallback logging when Edge Function is not available
âœ… **Error Handling**: Non-critical email errors won't break the checkout process

## Current Status
- **Checkout**: âœ… Works properly, shows thank you page after successful payment
- **Email**: ðŸ“§ Currently logging to console (Edge Function not deployed yet)
- **Admin**: âœ… Status updates work with email fallback logging

## Setting Up Edge Function (When Ready)

### Step 1: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Edge Functions" in the sidebar
3. Click "Create Function"
4. Name: `send-email`
5. Copy the TypeScript code from the previous setup instructions

### Step 2: Environment Variables
Add in Supabase Edge Function settings:
```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Get Resend API Key
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Create API key
3. Add to Supabase environment variables

### Step 4: Deploy
Click "Deploy" in Supabase dashboard

### Step 5: Test
- Place a test order
- Check console for success messages
- Verify emails are sent to customers

## Features
- **Order Confirmation Emails**: Sent after successful payment
- **Status Update Emails**: Sent when admin changes order status
- **Professional HTML Templates**: Branded with Dharika Fashion styling
- **Fallback Logging**: Works without Edge Function for development

## Email Templates Include
- Order details with items, pricing, shipping address
- Customer information and contact details
- Status-specific messages and color coding
- Professional Dharika Fashion branding
- Mobile-responsive design

## Current Fallback Behavior
Until Edge Function is deployed:
- All email attempts are logged to console
- Checkout flow continues normally
- Admin status updates work properly
- No emails are actually sent (logged only)
