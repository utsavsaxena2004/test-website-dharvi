              Hi, I'm <span className="font-semibold text-primary">Siya</span> ‚Äî the 18-year-old behind this chaos, colour, and community.

              What started in the middle of a noisy college canteen (yes, over cold fries and a barely-finished project brief) somehow turned into this. Dharika wasn't born out of a pitch deck ‚Äî it was born because we were given a project which needed to be done in 2 Hours. Who knew we would still be working on it months later.

            <p className="text-foreground/80">
              Today, Dharika is built by a crew of students, creators, and daydreamers ‚Äî all under 20 ‚Äî who are designing, shooting, writing, building, and figuring it out, together.
